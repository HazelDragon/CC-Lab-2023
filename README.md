Therapy Speak Quiz 

BACKGROUND
I'm a dual degree DT and psychology major, and I'm very intereste in relationships and interactions between people. I'm a person who is very much online and I've noticed the rise of 
"therapy speak", which is licensed therpaists giving advice on TikTok and IG which is malappropated into everyday life. People take these words out of context, which makes
for very strange conversations. I've also been obssessed with personality quizes such as MBTI and BuzzFeed. I wanted to make a site that was like that.

SITE INSPIRATIONS 
I was mainly inspired by the humanmetrics.com mbti test site. It is very nostalgic to me, and very simple. 

PROCESS
1) Write questions and answers
2) Code in html + css
3) Realize my project is too complex and my code will not work
4) Downscale
5) Use checkbox instead of label to accurately reflect score
6) figma redo CSS
7) final

CHALLENGES 
I was working on about 6 other projects at the same time in addition to teaching myself C# and JS at the same time. I was also going through a period of burnout, which contributed to me 
starting the project very late. It was very hard to scoring functions that added properly in JS, luckily I was able to figure it out. Overall I was very all over the place.
