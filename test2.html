    <p>About 23% of Americans are in therapy as of 2023, but people often get mental health advice from social media such as TikTok.
        Therapy Speak is defined as the rise of bringing language applied by therapists to their patients into everyday situations where it is not neccesarily needed.
        Most often seen in boundary setting (holding space), lying (gaslighting), or excusing bad behavior(honoring your inner child). 
        Check the boxes that apply to see if you have an unconscious tendency towards one of the terms.
